# RPA Automation Project (Financial Workflow)

## Project Overview

This project was developed during my first-year internship and involved building RPA (Robotic Process Automation) tools using Yingdao. The tool was designed to automate various internal financial tasks for the company, including but not limited to report generation, data entry, and automated data processing.

The goal of this project was to increase efficiency, reduce manual errors and time waste, and also to help me gain valuable hands-on experience. I used Python in combination with TagUIâ€™s Python interface for secondary development and successfully solved multiple real-world problems. The simplified version of this project is available on my GitHub for demonstration and archiving purposes.

## Tech Stack

- **Language**: Python  
- **Tool**: TagUI  
- **Version Control**: Git  
- **Operating System**: Windows / Linux  

## Background

During my internship, I was mainly responsible for automating financial data operations. My key tasks included:

1. **Automated Report Generation**: Used TagUI scripts to automatically generate specific financial reports, saving considerable time.
2. **Data Entry & Aggregation**: Built tools to scrape and aggregate data, minimizing manual input errors and improving processing speed.
3. **Cross-Platform Execution**: Combined Python scripts with TagUI to support task automation across both Windows and Linux platforms.

## Key Features

1. **Automated Financial Report Generation**  
   Designed RPA flows using TagUI to periodically generate financial reports and eliminate human error caused by repetitive tasks.

2. **Data Collection and Entry**  
   Developed automated scripts to collect financial data and input it into the system, significantly saving time and reducing errors.

3. **Scheduled Execution with Python**  
   Implemented scheduled automation using Python-based task schedulers to ensure regular, unattended task execution.

## Project Showcase

Due to company confidentiality, the complete project cannot be made public. However, I've simplified and shared key components of the codebase to demonstrate my skills and internship outcomes. Please refer to the GitHub repository for the sample code and documentation.
